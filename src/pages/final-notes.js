            <h1>Why Sayia</h1>
            <p>One day, while learning a language, I felt it was too difficult.
            There were too many words, and the grammar was complicated.</p>
            <p>So I tried to create a language with simpler grammar and vocabulary.
            I thought that if everyone knew this language in the future,
            I could find a toilet and get a milking job anywhere.</p>
            <p>That was how Sayia started.</p>
            <p>Later, I realized the idea was ridiculous.
            I still finished it anyway. It turned into a strange language.</p>
